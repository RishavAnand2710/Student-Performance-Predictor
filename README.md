This project aims to predict students' final grades using machine learning techniques applied to real-world educational data. Leveraging the UCI Student Performance Dataset, the model uses various academic and behavioral features — such as attendance, past grades, study time, and number of past failures — to forecast a student’s final exam score.

The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training using linear regression, and model evaluation based on metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score. Visualizations such as correlation heatmaps, distribution plots, and prediction vs actual scatter plots are used to understand the data patterns and model performance.

By analyzing historical student data, the model provides valuable insights for educators to identify at-risk students early and personalize learning interventions.
